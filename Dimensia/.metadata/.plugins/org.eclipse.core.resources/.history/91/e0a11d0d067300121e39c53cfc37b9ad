	Notable bug: it seems that after saving a world, sometimes the chunks can be corrupted 
		To fix: try stepping through the entire generation of a world, seeing where chunk gen fails.
				wierdly, it seems to only fail to load when run, not in debug mode. There's something
				to that probably. Likely issue where a chunk is never saved right?
			Note(2ish); possibly worldgen issue
			
Alpha 1.0.18
	Increased monster stun time from 0.25->0.4 seconds on hit
